# azure-virtual-network

Network layer: VNet + one regional subnet per tier (public/app/data/aks/appgw/privatelink), NSGs, route tables, NAT Gateway, Key Vault + Storage Account behind Private Endpoints, and observability (Flow Logs, Traffic Analytics, diagnostic settings to Log Analytics).

## Design decisions worth knowing before changing anything

- **One subnet per tier, not one per AZ.** Subnets are regional in Azure (they already span all zones) — HA comes from the `zones` argument on the *resources* deployed into them (VMs, VMSS, node pools), not from splitting subnets per AZ. If you see a suggestion to add `snet-app-az2`-style resources, that's the old design; don't reintroduce it.
- **`appgw` and `privatelink` subnets stay single** — always were, no per-AZ version ever existed for those.
- **`containerapps` subnet is delegated to `Microsoft.App/environments`** and sized `/23` (min supported is `/27`). The Container Apps Environment built on it (in `azure-container-apps-poc`) is internal-only on purpose — an *external* workload-profiles environment routes inbound traffic through a Microsoft-managed public IP that bypasses this subnet's NSG entirely, which would make `nsg-containerapps` pointless. Application Gateway is the only public entry point; it reaches the environment over the VNet.

## Backend

Remote state in Azure Blob Storage, provisioned by the sibling `azure-tfstate-bootstrap` project (not this one — chicken-and-egg). `backend.tf` here uses literal values (RG/storage account/container name), not partial config — decided deliberately: those values aren't secrets (no auth data in them), and partial config adds friction for no real security gain here. Key: `network/terraform.tfstate`.

## `subscription_id`

No default on purpose. **Set it with `TF_VAR_subscription_id`, not `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.** The provider block does `subscription_id = var.subscription_id` explicitly, so Terraform needs the *variable* populated — `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` alone does nothing here (it only auto-works if the provider block omits `subscription_id` entirely). Got this wrong twice already — don't repeat it.

## `prevent_destroy` on the resource group + VNet

Both have `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }`. To do a real full teardown: comment out both lifecycle blocks, `terraform destroy`, then **put them back** before the next apply. Don't leave them removed.

## Known destroy gotcha

Azure auto-creates `Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules` and `dataCollectionEndpoints` (named `NWTA-...`) as a side effect of Traffic Analytics on the Flow Log. These are never in Terraform state, so `terraform destroy` gets to the very last step (deleting the resource group) and fails with "Resource Group still contains Resources". Fix: `az resource list -g rg-network`, find the `NWTA-*` entries, `az resource delete --ids <them>`, then the resource group delete goes through (either re-run `terraform destroy` or `az group delete -n rg-network --yes` directly).

## Key Vault soft-delete

`kv-ha-vnet-demo` has Azure's mandatory soft-delete (not purge protection, which is off). After a destroy, check `az keyvault list-deleted` before a re-apply if the name conflicts.

## Consumers — check before renaming subnets/outputs

Other projects in this workspace read this module's outputs directly (no `terraform_remote_state` data source, just copied values):

| Project | Reads |
|---|---|
| `azure-jumpbox-server` | `app_subnet_id` |
| `azure-mysql-database` | `data_subnet_id` |
| `azure-lb-webserver` | subnet names directly (`snet-appgw`, app subnet names) |
| `azure-aks-cluster` | own backend via `azure-tfstate-bootstrap`; may reference subnet/NSG outputs |
| `azure-container-apps-poc` | `containerapps_subnet_id`, `appgw_subnet_id`. Does NOT read `key_vault_id` — uses its own dedicated Key Vault (this project's is Private-Endpoint-only, so a Terraform apply running outside the VNet can't do data-plane cert imports against it) |

Renaming a subnet, changing an output name, or changing a CIDR here can silently break any of these if they've been applied. Check before assuming it's safe — don't guess.

## Git remotes — single remote now

- `origin` → `github.com:xstratus/azure-virtual-network` (public)

Used to also dual-push to `jalcalaroot/azure-virtual-network`, but that account has moved off this old Azure subscription entirely (see the sibling `jalcalaroot-azure` project). The `jalcalaroot` mirror was renamed to `jalcalaroot/azure-virtual-network-xtratus` (2026-09-02) to free the `azure-virtual-network` name for a new, unrelated network module repo under the `jalcalaroot` account — it's a frozen snapshot now, not an active mirror. No more dual-push here.

## .gitignore convention

`*.tfstate*` and `*.tfvars` excluded (never commit real state/values). `.terraform.lock.hcl` **is** tracked intentionally (provider version reproducibility) — don't add it back to `.gitignore`. `.terraform/` (provider cache) excluded.

## If you find a secret in git history

Happened once already (a hardcoded `subscription_id`) — since these repos are small and young, squash to a single clean commit and force-push rather than trying to scrub individual commits. Confirm first (via `git log -S <the-secret>`) which commits actually contain it before deciding how deep the squash needs to go.
